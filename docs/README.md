# Things I Learnt

Hello world! The purpose of this website is to compile what I find noteworthy and beneficial to my own development and growth as a future CS student/software engineer. I hope that these posts would be as beneficial to you as they are to me. I always believed that educational knowledge should be made freely available to the public, so that anyone, regardless of their background, can learn freely.
